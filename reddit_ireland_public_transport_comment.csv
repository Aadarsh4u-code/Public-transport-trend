Shmokeahontis,"If you think it’s bad in Dublin, try outside Dublin. I had to travel two towns over for an mri this week. If I was driving it’s a 15 minute journey. 

It took me 5 hours. 5 hours to get a bus to that town, and get home. My mri appointment was over and done in 20 minutes, and I still couldn’t go home for hours. No bus. 

I remember growing up, walking to school along some old disused rail tracks. They took those tracks out eventually, poured tarmac, and called it a greenway. Now we don’t even have the framework for rail. 

The cost and the time it takes to get from A to B using public transport makes the whole venture not worth it, unless you have no choice.",192,2023-05-04 07:10:57

[deleted],"For those blocked by the pay wall:

Dublin has been ranked worst for public transport among 30 European capital cities by Greenpeace, based on affordability and simplicity for users in purchasing tickets.

The environmental campaign group has called for a Europe-wide reduced price ticket to address the climate and energy crises. Public transport it is too expensive in many places, it concludes, in an evaluation published on Thursday.

“In the context of the climate, energy and cost-of-living crises, the least polluting, healthiest and most efficient modes of transport should be affordable for everyone,” it says.

[ Free public transport would incentivise excessive travel, says report ]

Greenpeace is calling on national and local governments to introduce affordable “climate tickets” for public transport, and for the European Commission to facilitate this – “with a view to introducing a Europe-wide single climate ticket in the future”.",42,2023-05-04 06:45:17
chapkachapka,"For anyone interested, here is the actual study:

https://greenpeace.at/uploads/2023/05/report-climate-and-public-transport-tickets-in-europe.pdf

Despite every headline in the Irish press, this study is not about how much an individual trip costs, it’s about the availability of “climate tickets,” which are affordable long-term tickets that are good for all forms of transport in a country.

The focus of the report is on national transport, where Ireland is middle of the pack. Only about a dozen countries have any kind of unified national transport ticket. Ireland ranks first among countries that don’t, because of generous travel card schemes and 0% VAT on transport tickets.

There is also a city ranking where Dublin came in last, but price is not the main focus: it’s the fact that we’re the only European capital where you can’t just buy a monthly pass that gives you unlimited use of all city transport. So they’re comparing a monthly or even annual pass in other cities to the weekly Leap card fare cap.",45,2023-05-04 07:31:44

[deleted],"Here's an idea, why not charge the people based on the total distance travelled using public transportation inclusing bus and tram transfers? ~~10c per km?~~

How can this be efficiently done? Buses with entry and exit card readers. You ride a bus at the front door and tap your card to the reader upon boarding. When getting off, tap your card to the reader by the rear door exit.

Allow debit/credit card for payment. Pay by phone wallet to make payment simpler ang convenient.

How about cash users? Cash transactions slow the system significantly. Buy a bus card at any convenient store and keep the card for further transactions.

Edit: I am not an expert in pricing the appropriate fare for pubpic transportation. But the general idea is  buses can be made cheaper. Doesn't have to made free as drivers needs salary and buses needs maintenance as well.",-3,2023-05-04 06:56:07

TrippinSwitches,"In my opinion there are not enough busses and routes have too many stops. From using busses in France and Poland and other places in Europe they seem to have less stops. It is common for the bus to drive for 1 minute then has to pull over. 

The timetabe is poor. The fair price is too high. 

I did try to bus to work but like other comments I would need to take two. If the first one is late il miss the second meaing il have a 40min wait on the next one and Im late for work. 

The carbon emissions needs to be addressed but having people in cars sitting in traffic is not going to solve anything. It looks like this was the plan that too many people waiting in traffic would mean less would drive where as it had the opposite effect. 

A couple of ways I think could work.

Incentise work from home.

Directing routes passing through the city centre somewhere else would be less effective because town is where *a lot* of passengers want to go. They'd then have to get a connecting bus to town, and you've sacrificed proximity to the *other* links passing through town based on this model (DART and Luas).

This model isn't exactly ideal but radial routes through town and supporting orbital routes is what we're stuck with unless we want to level the city. The solution to busses getting stuck in congestion is to prioritise bus traffic by giving them clear corridors essentially free of passenger cars.

I understand that we should approach every issue with maturity and try and think through it, but I think blaming the city layout for the failure of the public transport system is erring on the other side. This service barely made any progress in the last 10 years and any solution applied matches not what the city will need in the future, but what the city needed years ago. The whole thing is struggling to understand if it is to be run as a for-profit organization or as a public service.
