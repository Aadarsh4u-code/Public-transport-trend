It's so weird and insane for me that owning a car is cheaper (and 3-4x as fast) to get at my work then public transport.  


Workdays and long trips are the only reasons for me to use the car.  
I think we can make a huge leap with improved and cheaper/free public transport to lower car use (at least if i look at my self).",28,2023-08-07 10:09:39
Kimmetjuuuh,"It was once calculated that free public transport would cost 4 billion euros. Keeping in mind that demand might increase when public transport becomes cheap, let's just say with 4 billion euros it'd be affordable. Considering a lot more money goes into car infrastructure, I think this would be a good thing.

Yes, there will be challenges, like the employment state of the NS right now. But at the end of the line, I think this would be a good thing. Especially as a small country like the Netherlands, we have to be responsible with our space. This can be done by making public transport more efficient.

Today, every new home is built with 1,7 car spaces per house. Car spaces that only get bigger, as cars are getting bigger too. If you'd sum up all the car spaces, you'd have a new Amsterdam. So let's koloniseer that space back and grab our OV and bicycle again.

Free public transport doesn't exist anywhere in the world (at scale) as far as I know. There's bound to be a reason for that... perhaps it is that it is remarkably expensive, and therefore unjust to finance through taxation, which is not tied to usage?",4,2023-08-07 09:16:18
CypherDSTON,"There are two things to discuss on free public transit (and by free, obviously free to use, paid for by taxes, same as any public service)...

1. Is free public transit, in the abstract a good idea. IMO yes, mobility should be free, we should only price something to control consumption in places where demand outstrips supply. If roads can be free, public transit is more efficient, obviously it could be free as well.
2. Should we actually implement public transit now or in the near term. IMO no, we need to increase the use of public transit to avoid climate disaster. And cost is not the primary obstacle to use of public transit, it is almost always quality of service.

That being said, Netherlands public transit is a heck of a lot better than back in Canada (and much better than the US). It's also much more expensive. So probably, Netherlands is closer to 1. than Canada or the US...but 2 is probably still applicable.",3,2023-08-07 10:48:51
uncle_sjohie,"Sounds like a great plan, but will suck in real life. Take the NS. Prior to the privatization, it was a horribly run government entity, with mediocre service, hemorrhaging tax money, and no decent money was made on the smaller lines.

Nowadays, those smaller regional lines are run by other companies, and believe it or not, the Netherlands is a country those (often) international companies want to operate in, we embrace new technologies and services, and are therefore a good place for them to trial new things. Thus giving us relatively modern and efficient public transport. And yes, there are plenty of things that go wrong, and should be done better, I know.

What would help, is taxing things like planes fairly, as in, factor in how much they impact the environment. And in our crowded country, a new railway is about 10 million per kilometer, excluding large objects like tunnels etc, whereas air is basically free to fly thru. All you need are some radars and controllers, and presto. If you fuel those planes with duty free kerosine, but demand NS uses green electricity, it's obvious it's far from a level playing field.

The downside of our already efficient public transport, means that there is no money to be saved that way, only thru reducing the frequency of services, or cut lines all together. This is a political decision, we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world, if we wanted to we could free the funds to reinstate all those closed stops or whole routes.

Spatial planning by governments would help some to, the last decade or so, the average distance from home to work has doubled, necessitating a lot of extra movement, especially during rush hours, meaning congested roads and trains filled to the brim.",5,2023-08-07 09:18:38
MET4,"Free public transport in the Netherlands might sound good, but it comes with challenges. First, it's costly and could strain the budget or lead to higher taxes. Second, overcrowding and inefficiencies may occur due to increased demand and it might discourage (more) eco-friendly options like cycling. Also, free rides could subsidize unnecessary trips, impacting congestion and sustainability. Instead, targeted investments in the existing system could be more effective. However subsidizing a part of the cost would help alot of these problems.",5,2023-08-07 08:51:48

What would be good is cheaper public transportation. There would still be a need for more trains and buses, so that would mean better working conditions.

Sure, they're not going to make as much as they're making right now with these insane prices and bad working conditions, but it is going to be a little better than not getting anything.

I suggest voting for a political party that doesn't want to turn every foundational aspect of our society into a for profit corporation.

Besides, even if we made if free it would just mean people would spend their money elsewhere, right? So making it free would be a boon for any other business. I know I would take public transport a lot more often and spend the money I would on the trip on having  a nice lunch or a museum instead. But when I see going anywhere is going to cost me 20 euro's just to ge there I don't bother.

y0l0naise,"‚ÄúBut someone has to pay for it‚Äù is a funny thing when it comes to public facilities, though

First of all, country finances are a bit different than personal finances. Sometimes, obviously, the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù is the tax payer, spreading the burden over a lot of people because we agree there‚Äôs a net benefit to it. Some other time the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù can be purely inflation, i.e. if you borrow ‚Ç¨10 billion, which is about 1% of our GDP today, in 20 years from now when it has to be paid back, that same ‚Ç¨10B is now only 0.67% of the GDP (2% inflation over 20 years), but the amount has stayed the same.

Secondly there‚Äôs the thing about the net benefit. It‚Äôs always hard to calculate but if you make public transport free, imagine how many people would have an increased mobility and what that means for the jobs they‚Äôll take, the friends & family they‚Äôll visit (public health benefits) and increased spending in places other than the place people call their home because they‚Äôre going somewhere for fun just because they can. So, add all those up and you just might ‚Äúsave‚Äù the 4B it costs to make public transport free in some other places.

See what you have in the US, many transit agencies there are public (not commercial) operations and they made it free. And it is still completely terrible regarding quantity and especially quantity. It being free sort of creates an expectation it is just for the poor or people who don't have a choice, that pulls in that crowd but turns away other potential passengers, and then the government doesn't really see a reason to invest in it as it is just a basic service that doesn't have to be competitive with any other traffic mode anyways.

alongthatwatchtower,"Tell me you're economically illiterate without telling me you're economically illiterate.

Railways are a natural monopoly. The privatised (competitive) system we currently have drives up prices.

The railroads themselves are owned by a private company (although the state is a majority shareholder). They ask money from railproviders (NS, Arriva etc.) for the privilege to use these railroads. This happens through bidding. The highest amount (ad other scores) gets the bid and the privilege to use the railroads (believe it or not, you can't have two trains on the same track going in opposite directions).

This causes pseudo-monopolies to spring up. Companies want to maximise their revenues when private, this goes for both the railroad company and railprovider. Since trains are a natural monopoly, all the extra costs from bidding, organising etc. Fall upon the consumer. At the same time, the railprovider (NS) needs to pay a large sum to the railroad company to make use of the tracks and maintain their monopoly. This means that they will always run as close to a deficit as possible. The railroad company on the other hand has a large amount of money that they mostly use on their own projects and will always go to the state (their majority shareholder) when wanting to make larger investments.

Nationalise the railways and (largest) railproviders of you want lower prices.",1,2023-08-08 08:16:43

NeverEndingLive,Seems like it but the government doesn't consider it that.,2,2023-08-07 20:41:15
PanickyFool,"But it is a nationalized company, owned by the government, and trying to have break even operations by direction of the government ( the same government it is 100% a part of).

This is the Netherlands, our government has been obsessed with user fee funded operations for decades.

If the government decided after the next election to remove the breakeven objective from NS operations it absolutely could without any change in the structure of the company that it 100% owns and controls! A.K.A it is already nationalized!

A.K.A it is nationalized",1,2023-08-07 19:32:55
Blussert31,"> The Netherlands is over-complicating a lot of departments

Absolutely true. But it came to be that way because we as a society time and again found things the government should do. And we're not easily giving that up.

Look at the toeslagenaffaire. We want to arrange all sort of schemes to get money to people with low income, working people with children, people with health care costs etc etc It could all be simpler but it isn't. And if we were to make a simple system, within a few years we'd screw it up with new rules, exceptions, subsidies etc.",1,2023-08-07 13:57:08
Blussert31,"Simple comparison : if you give people free food they will eat more. If you give people free travel, they will travel more. This will add more overcrwoding and more energy consumption.

If you want to get people out of their car, the problem is not so much in cost but in convenience. The train just has to be a better option. My commute by car takes 30 minutes. By train 90 minutes. The costs between the train trip or the car trip are basically the same, but the extra hour is the dealbreaker here.",1,2023-08-07 14:10:37

SamuelVimesTrained,"Fair enough.But I have the car anyway due to work (and unable to move closer to work) so, it is easier to use that.
